The in-built database engine also ensures that you do not\nneed to install or understand any third party database like most other applications. Akaunt is\ncompletely maintenance free without any administration required from your side. The perform-\nance is reflected with most of the reports coming up instantly. Overall you get a smooth experi-\nence with a lower cost of ownership.\n6.1.2 Data Reliability and automatic recovery\nAkaunt provides a high level of reliability of data with several technologies built into it. Your\ndata does not get corrupted even if there is a sudden machine shutdown or network breakdown or\npower cut. This is ensured using the concept of transaction atomicity?? which is supported by the\nobject oriented storage. Akaunt uses data integrity checks intensively to detect any change to\nyour data by external means. Any corruption happening in this way will be instantly detected as\nthe program operates the data with a timely warning to you. Besides providing a warning,\nAkaunt provides you a unique capability to recover from most corruptions by allowing you to\nsimply rewrite the data. The corrupted data is then discarded and you can continue with normal\noperations, at the most re-entering the corrupted transactions or masters only.\n6.2 Internet & Data exchange\n6.2.1 HTTP-XML based data interchange\nAkaunt uses a recursive object oriented data structure which can naturally and easily be\nexpressed as XML. Akaunt can export your data in XML format and can also import data\ncoming in XML format. This is a fundamental capability of the program and can be easily used to\nextract data for third party applications or to pump in data from third party applications as long as\nit is compliant with the schema of a voucher or master.\nThe process can be automated since Akaunt can run as an HTTP (Hyper text transfer\nprotocol) server and can process requests for import or export in HTTP-XML to this server from\nother applications. Even third party web applications written in ASP, PHP, Java etc. can talk to\nyour Akaunt running as an HTTP server and provide real-time information or remote data\ninput. The third party application can send a request to Akaunt to get any report in XML or\neven in HTML formats. Even new reports can be added by defining them in TDL (Tally Definition\nLanguage). In the same way, a master or a voucher can be created in XML and sent to Tally.ERP\n9 server as an HTTP-XML request and will be processed and stored by Akaunt.\nThis capability has been used to provide the synchronisation capability (explained in this\ndocument later) which allows data to be replicated, exchange between multiple Akaunt\ninstances running at same or different locations just by configuring the same.")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("6.3 ODBC - Open Database Connectivity\n6.3.1 ODBC data access\nAkaunt provides an ODBC (Open database connectivity) driver natively which allows other\napplications like MS-Excel (which can use an ODBC data source) to directly pick up data from\nAkaunt running as an ODBC server.
