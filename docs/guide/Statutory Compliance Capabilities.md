TCS is the Tax Collected at Source by you (collector) from a Buyer/lessee (collectee/payee). This
tax to be collected at source is applicable to goods, as specified under Section 206C of the
Income Tax Act, 1961. If the purchase value of goods is X, the amount payable by the buyer is
X+Y, where Y is the value of Tax at Source. The seller deposits the tax amount Y at any desig-
nated branch of banks authorised to receive such payments.
As a seller, lessor or licensor, you are responsible for the collection of tax from the buyer, lessee
or licensee. The tax is collected for sale of goods or on transactions which involve receipt of
amounts from buyers in the form of cash or cheque, draft or any other mode. The certificate of collection of 
Tax at Source has to be submitted in Form No. 27D by persons collecting tax at source within a week from the
 last day of the month in which the tax was collected.


Central Sales Tax
CST is a tax levied on inter-state sales of goods by dealers by the Central Government. CST is
applicable only if you sell goods to dealers in other states but not levied on sales made intra state
or on import/export sales. The Inter-state sale occurs when sale or purchase constitutes
movement of goods from one state to another. Accordingly, when you send consignments to your
agents or transfer goods to your branch/ other offices, this is not a considered as sale under the
CST Act.
193Statutory Compliance Capabilities in Akaunt
CST is payable in the state from where you sell the goods and commence its movement. The tax
you pay is collected and retained by the state where the transaction originated. The CST collec-
tion and administration is performed by the authorities of your state's Sales Tax Dept. Thus, the
State Government Sales Tax officer who assesses and collects VAT (state) also collects and
assesses and CST.
The CST feature is enabled automatically once the VAT feature is enabled in Akaunt.
